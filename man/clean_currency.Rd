\description{
Often Junar data involving currency data is not clean because for some reason
content and presentation of currency values is not separated). To clean up
this data quickly the following helper function accepts the position of the
character value for the currency and the thousands and decimal delimiters.
}
\details{
The currency character position defaults to the first character from the
left. And it refers directly to the symbol as present in the data frame
column, because some characters (such as the  symbol for the Costa Rican
Colon) give are uncommon and lead to multiple encoding and font errors.
